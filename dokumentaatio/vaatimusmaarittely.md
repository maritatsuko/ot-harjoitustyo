# ClosetApp

## Purpose of the application
The user can use the app to keep track of all the clothing items they own by uploading pictures. 
The app can be used by multiple registered users. Currently all users can upload, edit, and see the same pieces in the same closet.

## Basic functionality
### Before signing in
- The user can create an account
  - The username should be unique and 1 or more characters
  - The password should be 1 or more characters
- The user can log in
  - The user can login with an existing username and password

### After signing in
- the user can see the uploaded pictures | "tehty"
- the user can upload pictures of their clothes and choose a color and a category for the piece | "tehty"
- the user can log out | "tehty"
- the user can delete an uploaded piece | "tehty"
- the user can sort the uploaded clothes by color, category, and title | "tehty"

## Further ideas for implementation
The app can be further developed with features such as
- the user can save combinations of clothes as outfits
- users can save clothes uploaded by other users
- the user can delete their account and related information
- the user can search for an uploaded piece
